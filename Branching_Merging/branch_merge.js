    *** Braching And Marging ***
      => Branch: Branch is a new and separate branch of the master repo.
      => In a big project we separate the tasks / features and create branch so editing in the 
         new branch does not affect the master branch.
         
    *** The way of working with branch through with git command line
         => git branch branch_name
         => git checkout branch_name (Through which, we can go master brach to new creating branch)
         => git checkout master ( after finishing work, we can pass code to master brach)
         => git merge branch_name
